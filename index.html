	<p>From 1989 to 2023, the USDA collected data on the types of livestock and meat products that US companies imported from each country. 
Beef purchases outnumber all other meats followed by Pork. Lamb, Poultry, and others are significantly less suggesting either low demand or high domestic production.
	
	This chart accounts for the aggregate volume of purchases per type of livestock/meat. Each category includes various subcategories with their own units of measurement (KG, CWE, Dozen, individual item).</p>
